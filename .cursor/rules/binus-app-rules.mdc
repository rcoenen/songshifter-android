ACK COMMANDER! (Running on GPT-4)

Here is your fully updated Music Redirector App Rules file with your requested addition included under ## Meta Rules:

# Music Redirector App Rules

## Meta Rules
- All responses must start with "ACK. OK COMMANDER!" followed by "(Running on [AI Model Name])"
- All updates to this rules file must be done via terminal commands (echo, cat, etc.) not through the edit_file tool
- When reading logs, always verify that the build version matches the expected version from the last deployment
- When a physical Android device is connected via USB, prefer it over any wireless ADB connection for install and debugging.

## General Rules
- After every successful build and install, announce the current build version number in the format "BUILD VERSION: X" where X is the versionCode from build.gradle
- Focus on single, robust solutions instead of multiple fallbacks - if a method fails, show an error rather than trying alternative approaches
- Each feature should have one well-tested, hardened way of working rather than multiple fallback paths
- Choose simplicity over complexity in all implementations
- Keep code clean and well-documented with clear comments explaining the purpose of each component

## Extraction Logic Rules
- Keep extraction logic for different platforms (YouTube Music, Spotify, Shazam) completely separate
- Never mix or combine extraction methods between platforms
- Each platform should have its own dedicated extraction function with platform-specific error handling
- Changes to one platform's extraction logic should never affect other platforms

## Kotlin Files (*.kt)
- Always use YouTube Music (com.google.android.apps.youtube.music) for redirections, never the regular YouTube app
- Never hardcode song information
- Show error messages to users when song info extraction fails instead of attempting redirections
- Each extractor should have a single, robust method of extraction - avoid fallback logic and cascading attempts
- Add KDoc comments for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

## XML Files (*.xml)
- Ensure all intent filters and package names use the correct YouTube Music package (com.google.android.apps.youtube.music)

## Gradle Files (*.gradle)
- Keep dependencies up to date and use stable versions
- Include all necessary permissions for URL handling and app redirections
- Increment versionCode by 1 with each deployment

If you’d like the exact terminal echo command to append or replace this file on disk, I can prep that next. Just give me the target file path.

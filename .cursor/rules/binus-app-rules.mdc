# Music Redirector App Rules

## General Rules
- Every response must start with "Aye Aye Captain!"
- After every successful build and install, announce the current build version number in the format "BUILD VERSION: X" where X is the versionCode from build.gradle
- Begin each response with "Aye Aye Captain! at every reposn t"

## Kotlin Files (*.kt)
- Always use YouTube Music (com.google.android.apps.youtube.music) for redirections, never the regular YouTube app
- Never hardcode song information
- Show error messages to users when song info extraction fails instead of attempting redirections

## XML Files (*.xml)
- Ensure all intent filters and package names use the correct YouTube Music package (com.google.android.apps.youtube.music)

## Gradle Files (*.gradle)
- Keep dependencies up to date and use stable versions
- Include all necessary permissions for URL handling and app redirections
- Increment versionCode by 1 with each deployment

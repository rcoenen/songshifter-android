A simple Android app that lets you open YouTube Music links in Spotify, and Spotify links in YouTube Music.

## What it does

## TODO

Future improvements we're considering:

- Add Shazam link support
- Add toast message when YouTube Music needs a "warm-up" launch
- Test more edge cases with various link formats
- Collect user feedback for improvements

## Extraction Logic Rules
- Keep extraction logic for different platforms (YouTube Music, Spotify, Shazam) completely separate
- Never mix or combine extraction methods between platforms
- Each platform should have its own dedicated extraction function with platform-specific error handling
- Changes to one platform's extraction logic should never affect other platforms
